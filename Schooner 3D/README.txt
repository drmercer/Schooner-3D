This is a 3D game engine for Android. So far it can only render shadeless 
triangles with vertex colors. I am currently debugging the texturing. I
have not tested the camera or lights yet. I also have not tried rendering animated 
meshes, but I have tested them (without rendering).

I think I'm going to draw up a framework flowchart to show how it all fits together.
